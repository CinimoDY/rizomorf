<h2>build you own apps</h2>
<p>i follow nat on substack. he mentioned that a friend had nudged him to create a course about coding with ai. he was thinking about doing a course on coding with ai. this was around two weeks before christmas. Even though i thought the price was a bit steep, i signed up. It was the best decision i made that year.</p>
<p>Two ~10min videos into the course and i am almost ecstatic. install cursor.ai, initial setup done and i write my first prompt: &quot;Help me build a pomodoro timer that runs in my browser.&quot;
And voila! cursor.ai builds me a pomodoro timer. I get a html file, a css file and a js file. I have basic web development knowledge. but it woudl have taken me probably at least a couple of days to build a pomodoro timer just using html, css and js.</p>
<p>Nat goes on to show how to reference code and ask questions about it. It's a game changer.</p>
<h3>week 3-4: building projects</h3>
<p>The real breakthrough came when building actual projects. Instead of copying tutorials, I learned to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Describe features in natural language</li>
<li>Let AI suggest implementation approaches</li>
<li>Debug collaboratively with AI</li>
<li>Refactor code efficiently</li>
</ul>
<h3>key learnings</h3>
<ol>
<li>cursor.ai makes coding more efficient and fun</li>
<li>static sites are a good start for learning coding with ai</li>
<li>It helps to know what you want to build before you start</li>
<li>The ability to verify and validate AI suggestions is essential</li>
</ol>
<h2>current project</h2>
<p>This website is my second project using AI-assisted coding. I'm building it with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eleventy for static site generation</li>
<li>DOS-inspired design (because i love it)</li>
<li>Virtually no code development practices between my ears</li>
<li>&quot;AI pair programming&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>The process has been incredible and I'm learning more about both coding and AI interaction with each commit.</p>
<h2>what's next</h2>
<p>Planning to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add more interactive features</li>
<li>Implement a proper blog system</li>
<li>Create a projects showcase</li>
<li>Document my AI coding journey</li>
</ul>
<p>The course has given me confidence to tackle projects I wouldn't have attempted before. It's not just about writing code faster - it's about thinking about problems differently.</p>

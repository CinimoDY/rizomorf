It presents some of the lessons learned. It does not contain a detailed description of the 'Design Sprint' method. Links to relevant resources are provided at the end of this document. Our aim was to create and test a high-fidelity prototype in one week.\n\nThe views and lessons learned are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the other participants.\n\n## Challenge\nThere is no convenient way to record and share instructions for DIY projects. The challenge was to create one in 5 days using the SPRINT method.\n\n> \"Create a platform — the best open access self-study knowledge platform for any kind of project or topic.\" – prof. Nebe\n\n## Target Users\nMakers. Anyone interested in remaking or creating instructions for DIY projects.\n\n## Team Structure and Role\nThe group working on this project consisted of 12 students and the facilitator, professor Karsten Nebe. I participated in all the design activities and was additionally responsible for copywriting, structuring the prototype and finishing the documentation.\n\n> \"We all learn. All the time. How do we learn? By research, trial and error. Quite often by reproducing/ imitating. We copy and 'paste'. People rebuild, remake, rework\" – Prof. Nebe\n\n## Design Process\nThe Design Process was adapted from the Sprint Book. What follows is a breakdown of each day's activity.\n\n### Monday — Setting Goals and Listing Problems\nMonday began with an introduction to the topic and the sprint approach. We discussed the idea of creating a platform for making instructions for DIY jobs.\n\nIn order to come to a common understanding of the long term goals, we put together a list of success and failure factors: The sprint-questions.\n\nWith the long-term goal in mind, we created a map, consisting of the stakeholders, their activities and the core functions of our platform. The map illustrates the relationships between these aspects and represents the core concept.\n\nWe conducted four interviews with experts representing the needs of business stakeholders and typical users. We presented our map and the success and failure factors to the experts. They gave us valuable information on how to improve our concept and which aspects to focus on.\n\nThis information enabled us to set up How-Might-We Questions (HMW) to address the most important challenges. We collected the questions on post-its and sorted them into categories. We voted to identify the most relevant categories and localised these on our map.\n\nThree core aspects were identified:\n1. Sharing an idea\n2. Documenting ideas & projects\n3. Remaking projects\n\nEach participant chose one of these to work on for the next day. The facilitator picked the most important HMW questions from each category and shared the list with the students.\n\n#### Monday's Lessons Learned\n- User involvement and feedback at an early stage is essential\n- Our map should have been simpler\n- Interviewees had difficulty understanding the map. Consequently, explaining the map to the users took too long. In future, one should prepare scenarios to illustrate the idea\n\n### Tuesday — Sketching Day\nTuesday started with the lightning demos. We researched existing solutions that might fit with our project and promoted these ideas in 3-minute demos. The facilitator gathered useful ideas with a quick drawing on the whiteboard.\n\nSince our map was too complex, we circled back and simplified it. Only stakeholders relevant for the main workflow were kept.\n\nWe reviewed the data and concepts generated up to this point and each person jotted down his or her individual ideas and thoughts as to how best to proceed. This is an element described in the Sprint book, which maintains that group brainstorming is inefficient. Students kept their notes private and highlighted the points they deemed most promising.\n\n#### Crazy 8's\nEight minutes. Fold a sheet of paper to create eight frames. Hence crazy 8's. Sketch a variation of one of your best ideas in each frame. Spend one minute per sketch.\n\nEach person picked a favourite idea and asked themselves 'What could be another good way of doing this?', scribbled these new ideas down in less than a minute and repeated this with the next idea.\n\n#### Tuesday's Lessons Learned\n- Crazy 8's are useful and fun\n- I am unashamedly good at synthesising ideas\n\n### Wednesday — Decisions, Decisions!\nDay 3 started off with an \"Art Museum\" of the solution sketches. We selected the features to be included in the prototype by voting in heat map fashion.\n\nThe speed critique involved a round of three minute sessions criticising each sketch on its compatibility with the long term goal.\n\nA straw poll was conducted and the facilitator cast his super votes. This separated the 'Winning Ideas' from the 'Maybe Laters'. My Doc-Doc was a winner.\n\nWe concentrated on two major concepts: Everybody Can and Power of Us.\n\nWe split up into two groups. One sketched the Everybody Can prototype on a whiteboard. It focused on the workflow from the landing page to the project creation process. The other group sketched the The Power of Us prototype, dealing with the project creation workflow and community aspects.\n\n#### Wednesday's Lessons Learned\n- Getting everybody to concentrate on the main goal was challenging\n- Separating the themes Everybody Can and the Power of Us was a mistake\n- The names of the project threads were too abstract to convey concrete ideas\n- The power of us distracted people from the main goal\n- We should perhaps have been more rigid in keeping the scope manageable\n\n### Thursday — Prototyping and Test Preparations\nThe next phase was to bring the sketched prototype to life. We distributed tasks according to individual skills. The roles of makers, stitchers, writer, asset collectors and interviewers were assigned. We created a high-fidelity prototype based on the two storyboards.\n\nWe called the platform 'Loops' and the asset collectors quickly came up with a logo. The name reflects the potential of the product to be used as a tool for generating variations of existing projects on the platform.\n\nI, as the writer, worked on the copy and created an ad. We placed the ad in a magazine and used it to introduce our platform to test participants on the following day.\n\n#### Thursday's Lesson Learned\n- It helps to have Photoshop and Sketch experts on your team\n- Parts of the prototype got changed around before the test. 'Freezing' the prototype is super important\n\n### Friday — Test Day\nThe test setup consisted of an interview room and an observation room. Our magazine ad was given to the interviewees as an introduction to the product. They were then asked them to use the prototype and encouraged to think out loud and give candid feedback. We observed the test participants through a one way mirror and followed their interactions with the prototype via video. The sprint team collected notes and observations on a whiteboard.\n\nFollowing a recap of Friday's test sessions we gathered for a final wrap up. People made a list of their personal top 3 aspects for the platform. The overall three core aspects were:\n\n1. Take the Pain out of Documentation — this really is the root of the problem\n2. Make Re-creation a Breeze — with detailed requirements, instructions and supplier integration\n3. Engagement by Rewards — building a strong community, implementing a licensing system and using elements of gamification to keep users engaged\n\n## Retrospective\nThe scope of the project was too big. Time spent thinking about community aspects of the platform would have been better spent concentrating on how to improve the documentation process. This approach would have lead to a better prototype. Testing Community features with only three users in a single day was in my opinion insufficient.\n\nAfter the project had come to an end, I realised how much more fun it had been than the one we did in the first semester. The sprint format proved to be a quick and effective tool for design exploration and validation.

Originally developed in 2006 for the german news portal Handelsblatt.com, the series is now produced for the online division of german public television broadcaster ZDF.\n\nEvery episode of the series is published under a public license (CC), which permits viewers to download, embed and re-distribute the videos in their own internet sites in original or even modified form. Episodes of \"Elektrischer Reporter\" can even be downloaded from BitTorrent portals like ThePirateBay.org - legally.\n\nApart from talking heads the internet culture topics are almost pictureless (a massive problem for the coverage of those topics in video formats …). \"Elektrischer Reporter\" however has found his own special way of presentation: Off comments are accompanied by associative pictures of everyday life or by retro film snippets. Complex contexts are illustrated and explained with funny cartoons. The \"electric reporter\" himself presents the trendsetting topics as a cool retro style TV host in a drawn black-and-white studio.\n\n## Project Details\n- **Timeline**: February 2009 - 2011\n- **Client**: Blinkenlichten Produktionen\n- **Role**: Podcast Production\n\n## Responsibilities\n- Camera\n- Interviews\n- Footage Research\n- Post Production\n- Collaboration with 2 Journalists, a narrator, a post production agency and lots of interesting people we interviewed\n\n## Tools\n- Internet Archive\n- Adobe Premiere and After Effects\n- Photoshop ","url":"/rizomorf/ux-work/elektrischer-reporter.html","type":"ux-work"},{"title":"UX Work","content":"---\ntitle: UX Work\ndescription: A collection of UX design projects and case studies\nlayout: ux-index.njk\npermalink: /ux-work/index.html\ntags: uxWork\n---\n\n# UX Work\n\nWelcome to my UX portfolio.\n\n## Projects","url":"/rizomorf/ux-work/ux-work.html","type":"ux-work"},{"title":"meet.able","content":"---\ntitle: meet.able\nlayout: ux-project.njk\nrole: Usability Engineer\ntimeline: 2009\noverview: Concept for a multi-touch tabletop computer to support small group design meetings\ntags: uxWork\npermalink: /ux-work/meet-able.html\n---\n\n# meet.able\n\n## Project Details\n- **Fields**: human computer interaction, design meetings, collaboration, table top computing, natural user interfaces\n- **Type**: concept\n- **Methods**: field observation, literature research, prototyping, scenario\n- **Principles**: humane computer interaction design, ubiquitous computing\n- **Tools**: adobe premiere and after effects, mind maps\n\n## Overview\nmeet.able is a concept for an interactive table to connect the digital and physical worlds at meetings. It demonstrates what devices like this should be capable of doing and how they can increase effectiveness at meetings while also being fun to use. This project was my bachelor thesis. My supervisors were Prof. Dr.-Ing. Dr. Thomas Ritz and Dipl. Des. Tim Bruysten.\n\n![Jeff Han's TED presentation about DIY multitouch tabletop computing](/images/ux-work/meet-able/jeff-han-ted.jpg)\n\nMy creative process was motivated by Jeff Han's TED presentation about DIY multitouch tabletop computing.\n\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n  <div class=\"vp-preview vp-preview-cover vp-preview-invisible\" id=\"vp-preview\" \n       data-thumb=\"https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/86518945-f2d1935b375528753ed896f2e19300e1f3a383611e8c5be77aef683eccbf5e85-d?mw=900&mh=506\" \n       data-thumb-width=\"900\">\n  </div>\n</div>\n\n## Challenge\nParticipants at business meetings often bring laptops and mobile phones as well as paper documents to the table. Sharing and organising content can be time-consuming and complicated. The problem was to overcome these difficulties by using a common interface on the table itself. Designing for co-located workspaces presents new difficulties. Territoriality and multi-modality are two of the main issues.\n\n## Target Users\nThe scenario I took as an example was that of a meeting of creative people involved in software and website development: A project manager, a design strategist, a software developer and a designer. They met around a large multi-touch table and brought with them paper notebooks, sketches, graphics, scrap paper and mobile devices.\n\n## Team Structure and Role\nI got by with a little help from my friends and my supervisors.\n\n## Constraints\nThe scope of the project was wide before I began. In order to come up with a feasible concept, I had to do research, define the problems in detail and find solutions.\n\n## Design Process\n### Methodology\n![Methodology diagram showing the design process](/images/ux-work/meet-able/design-process.png)\n\nThe development of the design concept is in essence a meshing of the users' needs with the most appropriate technologies available. Much has been written on the theoretical aspects of what makes a good user interface. These aspects, where applicable, are also included in the design concept.\n\nTo illustrate some basic aspects of the meet.able I describe the making of a concept video. This was created using filmed, green screen sequences, which were subsequently animated.\n\nAs the concept itself cannot be directly user tested, the video is used as a way to obtain an evaluation of the idea. The video was published on the internet and viewers were encouraged to give their reactions and criticism.\n\nFinally, the ideas presented in this case study, together with possible further developments, are outlined in the section Summary and Future Work.\n\n### Research\nAfter much theoretical research into Human Computer Interaction Design I made an attempt to sort things out. To get an overview of all the issues involved I created a Mind Map:\n\n![Mind Map of HCI design concepts](/images/ux-work/meet-able/mindmap.png)\n\n...and a Problems vs Options-Diagram:\n\n![Problems vs Options diagram](/images/ux-work/meet-able/proboptiondiagram.png)\n\nOne thing became clear: Work on this chart could go on forever. The technological possibilities are vast and the pace at which new ones become available in this age of exponential acceleration is too rapid to keep updating the chart.\n\n### Field Research\nIn order to find out how design team meetings work and what kind of problems people have in discussing ideas and concepts around a table, I did some field research. I went to observe a meeting at Kada-Wittfeld, an architecture agency in Aachen, to understand better what processes are important. I paid particular attention to the actors positions around the table and their interactions with the table surface, space allocation and other objects used in the meeting.\n\n![Notes from the design team meeting](/images/ux-work/meet-able/meeting-notes.png)\n\nI saw that new creative ideas are seldom generated during meetings. More commonly, I learned, they arise in less formal contexts. Meetings are for presenting and discussing ideas and coordinating group activities. The meet.able is conceived to facilitate such tasks.\n\nMeet.able supports all the most significant user behaviours observed during meetings. These include flexible switching between single and multi-user working spaces, the ubiquitous use of pencil and paper (even when the paper is digital), and the exchange of planning data for future events, calendar entries and milestones.\n\n## Innovation: The Resting Hand Gesture\n![Demonstration of the Resting Hand Gesture interface](/images/ux-work/meet-able/resting-hand.png)\n\nAs a user-friendly interface that does not disrupt social interaction, I introduced the 'Resting Hand Gesture', which serves as a central starting point for each user. You simply to lay your hand flat on the screen to invoke an array of command menu buttons at your finger tips.\n\nNote: I have found no reference predating my publication at dominickennedy.de/ba (February 2009) describing a menu that appears at ones fingertips on multi-touch tabletop displays. The 'Resting Hand Gesture' is an innovation that I introduced. If you find evidence for a similar function prior to this date please let me know.\n\nI considered patenting it, but 2000 Euros for a patent that just covered Europe was too expensive for me at that time. In retrospect, I think I should have patented it, as a designer working for Adobe took up the RHG idea and adapted it for hand-held tablets in Adobe Eazel.\n\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n  <iframe src=\"path/to/concept-video\" title=\"Meet.able concept video demonstration\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\nI also made a few mini videos showcasing specific interactions:\n\n<div class=\"video-wrapper\">\n  <iframe src=\"path/to/business-card-demo\" title=\"Scanning a paper business card demo\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n</div>\n\n## Feedback\nI used the feedback from the UX community as a basic means of evaluating the concept. The video only portrays the most significant features of the table. A more comprehensive description was be published in my bachelor thesis in February 2009.\n\nI posted a note on my thesis in the NUI group forums. It didn't take long before feedback started coming in. Fubiz, a design blog from France published an article about meet.able. Others, from all over the world copied the article and brought further attention to my project. Special thanks go to Elizabeth Bacon, Christopher Moore, KevinNuut.com, Martin Polley and Jonathan Brill from 'Point and Do' for giving their professional feedback and opinions. I greatly appreciate it.\n\n![Map showing global interest in the project](/images/ux-work/meet-able/feedback-map.png)\n\n## Retrospective\nThis is still one the projects I am most proud of. It was a deep dive into HCI and design thinking. I learned so much by reading a lot of UI literature, learning about modes, modality, Fitt's law, tabletop territoriality, touch gestures and many other topics. It was something I very much enjoyed: Conducting my first user research; observing and synthesising, choosing the most pressing issues and conceptualising solutions. This is what I want to do more of. In retrospect the production of the video took too long and was not exactly rapid prototyping. Today I would opt for a more rapid method: A Wizard-of-Oz scenario of sorts, maybe. I was using a version of lean research back in 2009, 7 years before I hosted, as a student volunteer with the german UPA, a workshop on lean research by Tomer Sharon of WeWork.\n\nInteractive multi-touch tabletop computers will soon be in common use. Amongst other things, they will offer new possibilities for presenting, sharing and organising ideas during meetings. At least, that's what I and many others believed in 2009. Although the exploration of multi-touch enabled tabletop computers is ongoing, and meet.able is referenced in other projects, such as [this paper from 2011](http://www.user.tu-berlin.de/komm/CD/paper/061512.pdf), their use is mostly restricted to public spaces.\n\nYou can find the project page at dominickennedy.de/ba ","url":"/rizomorf/ux-work/meet-able.html","type":"ux-work"},{"title":"mms Intelligent Media System","content":"---\ntitle: mms Intelligent Media System\nlayout: ux-project.njk\nrole: Usability Engineer\ntimeline: 2014\noverview: Improving complex digital signage software\ntags: uxWork\npermalink: /ux-work/mms-ims.html\n---\n\n# mms Intelligent Media System\n\n## Project Details\n- **Fields**: digital signage, agile, b2b, marketing, user interfaces, information architecture\n- **Type**: desktop / browser application, mobile app, touch kiosk interface\n- **Methods**: user centred design, lean user research, field observation, rapid prototyping, usability testing\n- **Activities**: creating wireframes, creating personas, specify user requirements, negotiating with stakeholders, negotiating budgets, adapting user centred design, internationalisation\n- **Tools**: pen & paper, axure rp pro, photoshop, illustrator\n\n## Overview\nThe Intelligent Media System (IMS) is a platform for digital signage that facilitates the scheduling and distribution of content to screens at multiple distant locations. It is an online based command centre used by businesses running large media networks. It consists of several independent, but interconnected applications: The IMS Manager, The IMS Monitoring Tools, IMS Setup Tools and the IMS Content Creator.\n\nIf you are unfamiliar with digital signage it's basically the use of digital screens to display information in public spaces. Think of digital menu boards, retail way-finding, screens in busses and trains and at airports.\n\n## Challenge\nThe challenge was to redesign a rather complicated digital signage software suite so it would look amazing and customers would love to use it.\n\n## Target Users\nThe target users were businesses with digital screens in multiple locations. Each screen had to be fed with video content or custom websites. These were big companies like Douglas Holding Perfumery, NEC and the public transport system in Aachen (ASEAG). Of course it is people that actually use the software, not companies. People managing play-out.\n\n## Team Structure and Role\n### Team Structure\nThe project team included the CEO and the CTO, 4 software developers, a graphic designer, a marketer, an information architecture specialist and me, an interaction designer with the goal of applying a human-centred design process.\n\n### My Role\nMy role as the Interaction Designer and User Experience Lead involved:\n- Developing personas\n- Generating concepts\n- Designing user interfaces\n- Creating design specifications (design patterns, colour scheme, etc.)\n- Designing for improved human-computer interactions\n- Testing the usability of software\n- Writing original copy\n- Internationalising text components\n- Creating wireframes\n- Solving scheduling problems for media play-out to multiple screens at various locations across Germany and internationally\n- Re-working the marketing material for the landing page and trade fair brochures\n\n## Constraints\nBudget was an issue. There wasn't one. At least for user research. There was, understandably, pressure from the investors for quick returns on their investments. Under these conditions I fought for and got the opportunity to make field observations on our main customer. From these observations I derived the persona. I also implemented a 'feedback button' into the software, created a method for collecting and prioritising the issues reported and introduced the 'red routes' technique put forward by David Travis.\n\n## Design Process\nIMS is a software product that, when I joined the project, was already on the market and in use. So my first job was to get up to speed with it, find out how it was constructed and how customers were using it. My tasks included:\n\n- Redesigning the IMS manager\n- Improving the usability of Setup and Monitoring tools\n- Designing a 'Content Creator' tool for creating dynamic content\n\nNon-disclosure agreements do not allow me to go into detail here. The work samples shown here have in part been reworked to approved by the company now maintaining the intelligent media system.\n\n### Understand and Research\nThe first couple of months developers, system architects, CTO, CEO and marketing people were introducing me to the software and giving me their perspectives on what was great, what they thought needed change and what was missing. I then went on to interviews and field studies, which informed a user flow diagram.\n\nI then started to identify the major areas where improvements were necessary and to develop appropriate solutions. I changed the interface from Excel-like to a more user friendly, engaging one. I was guided by a helped create a graphical workflow that more closely afforded the outcome that the user wanted.\n\nThe workflow included:\n1. Add media files to your library\n2. Place media in Channels, add individual playout rules\n3. Assign your Channel to displays, touch interfaces or video walls\n\nTo help the developers and CEO's have a clear picture of the user's expectations, I created a persona of the archetypical IMS user. I used Barnabas Nagy's template because I liked it and I figured it would be effective at engaging our team of developers. If it shifted my teams awareness towards our users ever so slightly, it's a success.\n\n### Prototyping\nI used paper prototypes to test new interfaces and micro interactions where I saw room for improvement. I then created a prototype in Axure RP Pro.\n\nThe graphic designers created higher fidelity screens which I fed back into the Axure RP prototype to make a clickable Version.\n\n### Prototype Testing and User Feedback\nI visited our main customer, who was using the then current software version, and tested my ideas by getting an employee to use a prototype I had created in Axure. I timed her on a couple of task completion challenges and learned that the prototype was more efficient. Probably a result applying Fitt's law and streamlining the interface. It was also rated more fun to use. She liked the colours. By watching her use the prototype and observing her walk through the most common tasks I learned that some parts were not easy to understand. So I changed them.\n\nTo give our customers full control of their media system is to enable them to easily define various time spans and repetitions for media content. Getting this right took many hours of research and trial and error.\n\n### UI Specifications\nI initiated and supervised the creation of UI style guides by the graphic designers to be used by the company across all products. This guide made it a lot easier to maintain consistency across the various applications.\n\n## Marketing Aspects\nI created layouts and copy for a new company homepage.\n\n## Retrospective\nI was able to raise awareness at mainstream for the importance of design related issues.\n\nThe method of getting feedback from customers by having our marketing and sales people gather information during customer visits was sub-optimal. One really has to observe what users do: What they say and what they need can be two entirely different things, which is why we shouldn't pay attention to what people say but instead observe their behaviour in context.\n\nI've learned never to design a product without having met the people who will be using it.\n\nAs a result of my experience with this project I decided to deepen my knowledge and skills in this area by studying for a masters degree in Usability Engineering. This I am doing at the Rhine-Waal University.\n\nmainstream media solutions GmbH closed it's doors in 2014. The software I worked on was bought by another company. It is still in use today under another name. see https://walkby-sys.de ","url":"/rizomorf/ux-work/mms-ims.html","type":"ux-work"},{"title":"About","content":"---\ntitle: About\ndescription: About me and this site\nlayout: base.njk\npermalink: /about.html\n---\n\n# Welcome!\nYou have found your way to my webnode/index which i can now directly edit\n\n<section>\n\n## who am i?\ni enjoy creating tools that make life easier.\n\n- music production and sound design\n- creative coding and generative art\n- user experience design\n- web development\n\n</section>\n\n<section>\n\n## drive D:\nWhat drives D?

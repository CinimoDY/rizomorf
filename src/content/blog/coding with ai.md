## build you own apps

i follow nat on substack. he mentioned that a friend had nudged him to create a course about coding with ai. he was thinking about doing a course on coding with ai. this was around two weeks before christmas. Even though i thought the price was a bit steep, i signed up. It was the best decision i made that year.

Two ~10min videos into the course and i am almost ecstatic. install cursor.ai, initial setup done and i write my first prompt: "Help me build a pomodoro timer that runs in my browser." 
And voila! cursor.ai builds me a pomodoro timer. I get a html file, a css file and a js file. I have basic web development knowledge. but it woudl have taken me probably at least a couple of days to build a pomodoro timer just using html, css and js.

Nat goes on to show how to reference code and ask questions about it. It's a game changer.


### week 3-4: building projects
The real breakthrough came when building actual projects. Instead of copying tutorials, I learned to:
- Describe features in natural language
- Let AI suggest implementation approaches
- Debug collaboratively with AI
- Refactor code efficiently

### key learnings
1. cursor.ai makes coding more efficient and fun
2. static sites are a good start for learning coding with ai
3. It helps to know what you want to build before you start
4. The ability to verify and validate AI suggestions is essential

## current project

This website is my second project using AI-assisted coding. I'm building it with:
- Eleventy for static site generation
- DOS-inspired design (because i love it)
- Virtually no code development practices between my ears
- "AI pair programming"

The process has been incredible and I'm learning more about both coding and AI interaction with each commit.

## what's next

Planning to:
- Add more interactive features
- Implement a proper blog system
- Create a projects showcase
- Document my AI coding journey

The course has given me confidence to tackle projects I wouldn't have attempted before. It's not just about writing code faster - it's about thinking about problems differently.

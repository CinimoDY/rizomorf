## Content Remixer

https://remixer-opal.vercel.app/

The Content Remixer is an experimental tool that helps generate variations of text content using AI. I built it to explore the Vercel AI SDK and experiment with different ways of remixing content.

### Features
- Input any text content to remix
- Select from different remix styles (casual, formal, creative)
- Real-time AI-powered content generation
- Simple, focused interface

### Technical Details
Built with:
- React for the frontend UI
- Vercel AI SDK for AI integration
- OpenAI's GPT models for text generation
- Vercel for hosting and deployment

### Development Process
1. Set up React project with Vite
2. Integrated Vercel AI SDK
3. Created minimal UI for text input/output
4. Added remix style selection
5. Implemented AI streaming response
6. Deployed to Vercel

### Learnings
- Working with AI APIs and streaming responses
- Managing state with React hooks
- Building focused, single-purpose tools
- Deploying full-stack AI applications

### Future Improvements
- Add more remix styles and options
- Improve error handling
- Add content history/saving
- Enhance UI feedback during generation

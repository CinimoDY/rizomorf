# Design Sprint: Loops

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
A five-day design sprint focused on reimagining music creation interfaces. The project explored new ways for musicians to create and manipulate loop-based compositions, with an emphasis on intuitive controls and visual feedback.

## CHALLENGE
The project aimed to solve several key issues:
- Complex learning curve of existing music software
- Disconnect between visual and audio feedback
- Limited intuitive control over loop manipulation
- Need for real-time collaboration features
- Balance between simplicity and professional features

## PROCESS
### Day 1: Map
- Defined long-term goal
- Listed sprint questions
- Created user journey map
- Interviewed target users
- Identified key opportunities

### Day 2: Sketch
- Lightning demos of existing solutions
- Crazy 8s sketching exercises
- Solution sketching
- Silent critique
- Heat map voting

### Day 3: Decide
- Storyboard creation
- Decision matrix
- Risk assessment
- Prototype planning
- Feature prioritization

### Day 4: Prototype
- Created high-fidelity mockups
- Built interactive prototype
- Implemented basic audio feedback
- Prepared testing scenarios
- Documented assumptions

### Day 5: Test
- Conducted user testing sessions
- Gathered feedback
- Analyzed results
- Identified next steps
- Documented learnings

## OUTCOME
The sprint resulted in:
- Working prototype of visual loop interface
- Positive user testing feedback
- Clear direction for future development
- Innovative approach to loop visualization
- Strong foundation for MVP development

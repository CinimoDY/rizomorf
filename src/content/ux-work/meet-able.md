# meet.able

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
meet.able is a digital platform designed to bridge the gap between people with and without disabilities. The platform focuses on connecting individuals based on shared interests, hobbies, and activities, moving away from traditional disability-focused platforms that often emphasize limitations rather than possibilities.

## CHALLENGE
The main challenge was creating an inclusive platform that:
- Avoids stigmatization and focuses on abilities rather than disabilities
- Makes accessibility a core feature rather than an afterthought
- Facilitates genuine connections based on shared interests
- Ensures safety and trust while maintaining user privacy

## PROCESS
### Research Phase
- Conducted interviews with potential users from both target groups
- Analyzed existing platforms and their limitations
- Researched accessibility guidelines and best practices
- Created user personas and journey maps

### Design Phase
- Developed wireframes with accessibility in mind
- Conducted usability testing with diverse user groups
- Iterated on the design based on user feedback
- Created high-fidelity prototypes

### Implementation
- Worked closely with developers to ensure accessibility
- Conducted regular testing with screen readers
- Implemented user feedback mechanisms
- Created documentation for future development

## OUTCOME
meet.able successfully launched as a beta platform, receiving positive feedback from both user groups. Key achievements include:
- Intuitive interface that works well with assistive technologies
- Focus on interests and activities rather than disabilities
- Strong privacy controls and safety features
- Growing user base with active community engagement

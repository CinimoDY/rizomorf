    <h1>Design Sprint: Loops</h1>
<h2>Project Details</h2>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This is an experience report about a Google Ventures Design Sprint in a university setting. It presents some of the lessons learned. It does not contain a detailed description of the 'Design Sprint' method. Links to relevant resources are provided at the end of this document. Our aim was to create and test a high-fidelity prototype in one week.</p>
<p>The views and lessons learned are my own and do not necessarily reflect those of the other participants.</p>
<h2>Challenge</h2>
<p>There is no convenient way to record and share instructions for DIY projects. The challenge was to create one in 5 days using the SPRINT method.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Create a platform — the best open access self-study knowledge platform for any kind of project or topic.&quot; – prof. Nebe</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Target Users</h2>
<p>Makers. Anyone interested in remaking or creating instructions for DIY projects.</p>
<h2>Team Structure and Role</h2>
<p>The group working on this project consisted of 12 students and the facilitator, professor Karsten Nebe. I participated in all the design activities and was additionally responsible for copywriting, structuring the prototype and finishing the documentation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We all learn. All the time. How do we learn? By research, trial and error. Quite often by reproducing/ imitating. We copy and 'paste'. People rebuild, remake, rework&quot; – Prof. Nebe</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Design Process</h2>
<p>The Design Process was adapted from the Sprint Book. What follows is a breakdown of each day's activity.</p>
<h3>Monday — Setting Goals and Listing Problems</h3>
<p>Monday began with an introduction to the topic and the sprint approach. We discussed the idea of creating a platform for making instructions for DIY jobs.</p>
<p>In order to come to a common understanding of the long term goals, we put together a list of success and failure factors: The sprint-questions.</p>
<p>With the long-term goal in mind, we created a map, consisting of the stakeholders, their activities and the core functions of our platform. The map illustrates the relationships between these aspects and represents the core concept.</p>
<p>We conducted four interviews with experts representing the needs of business stakeholders and typical users. We presented our map and the success and failure factors to the experts. They gave us valuable information on how to improve our concept and which aspects to focus on.</p>
<p>This information enabled us to set up How-Might-We Questions (HMW) to address the most important challenges. We collected the questions on post-its and sorted them into categories. We voted to identify the most relevant categories and localised these on our map.</p>
<p>Three core aspects were identified:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sharing an idea</li>
<li>Documenting ideas &amp; projects</li>
<li>Remaking projects</li>
</ol>
<p>Each participant chose one of these to work on for the next day. The facilitator picked the most important HMW questions from each category and shared the list with the students.</p>
<h4>Monday's Lessons Learned</h4>
<ul>
<li>User involvement and feedback at an early stage is essential</li>
<li>Our map should have been simpler</li>
<li>Interviewees had difficulty understanding the map. Consequently, explaining the map to the users took too long. In future, one should prepare scenarios to illustrate the idea</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tuesday — Sketching Day</h3>
<p>Tuesday started with the lightning demos. We researched existing solutions that might fit with our project and promoted these ideas in 3-minute demos. The facilitator gathered useful ideas with a quick drawing on the whiteboard.</p>
<p>Since our map was too complex, we circled back and simplified it. Only stakeholders relevant for the main workflow were kept.</p>
<p>We reviewed the data and concepts generated up to this point and each person jotted down his or her individual ideas and thoughts as to how best to proceed. This is an element described in the Sprint book, which maintains that group brainstorming is inefficient. Students kept their notes private and highlighted the points they deemed most promising.</p>
<h4>Crazy 8's</h4>
<p>Eight minutes. Fold a sheet of paper to create eight frames. Hence crazy 8's. Sketch a variation of one of your best ideas in each frame. Spend one minute per sketch.</p>
<p>Each person picked a favourite idea and asked themselves 'What could be another good way of doing this?', scribbled these new ideas down in less than a minute and repeated this with the next idea.</p>
<h4>Tuesday's Lessons Learned</h4>
<ul>
<li>Crazy 8's are useful and fun</li>
<li>I am unashamedly good at synthesising ideas</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wednesday — Decisions, Decisions!</h3>
<p>Day 3 started off with an &quot;Art Museum&quot; of the solution sketches. We selected the features to be included in the prototype by voting in heat map fashion.</p>
<p>The speed critique involved a round of three minute sessions criticising each sketch on its compatibility with the long term goal.</p>
<p>A straw poll was conducted and the facilitator cast his super votes. This separated the 'Winning Ideas' from the 'Maybe Laters'. My Doc-Doc was a winner.</p>
<p>We concentrated on two major concepts: Everybody Can and Power of Us.</p>
<p>We split up into two groups. One sketched the Everybody Can prototype on a whiteboard. It focused on the workflow from the landing page to the project creation process. The other group sketched the The Power of Us prototype, dealing with the project creation workflow and community aspects.</p>
<h4>Wednesday's Lessons Learned</h4>
<ul>
<li>Getting everybody to concentrate on the main goal was challenging</li>
<li>Separating the themes Everybody Can and the Power of Us was a mistake</li>
<li>The names of the project threads were too abstract to convey concrete ideas</li>
<li>The power of us distracted people from the main goal</li>
<li>We should perhaps have been more rigid in keeping the scope manageable</li>
</ul>
<h3>Thursday — Prototyping and Test Preparations</h3>
<p>The next phase was to bring the sketched prototype to life. We distributed tasks according to individual skills. The roles of makers, stitchers, writer, asset collectors and interviewers were assigned. We created a high-fidelity prototype based on the two storyboards.</p>
<p>We called the platform 'Loops' and the asset collectors quickly came up with a logo. The name reflects the potential of the product to be used as a tool for generating variations of existing projects on the platform.</p>
<p>I, as the writer, worked on the copy and created an ad. We placed the ad in a magazine and used it to introduce our platform to test participants on the following day.</p>
<h4>Thursday's Lesson Learned</h4>
<ul>
<li>It helps to have Photoshop and Sketch experts on your team</li>
<li>Parts of the prototype got changed around before the test. 'Freezing' the prototype is super important</li>
</ul>
<h3>Friday — Test Day</h3>
<p>The test setup consisted of an interview room and an observation room. Our magazine ad was given to the interviewees as an introduction to the product. They were then asked them to use the prototype and encouraged to think out loud and give candid feedback. We observed the test participants through a one way mirror and followed their interactions with the prototype via video. The sprint team collected notes and observations on a whiteboard.</p>
<p>Following a recap of Friday's test sessions we gathered for a final wrap up. People made a list of their personal top 3 aspects for the platform. The overall three core aspects were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take the Pain out of Documentation — this really is the root of the problem</li>
<li>Make Re-creation a Breeze — with detailed requirements, instructions and supplier integration</li>
<li>Engagement by Rewards — building a strong community, implementing a licensing system and using elements of gamification to keep users engaged</li>
</ol>
<h2>Retrospective</h2>
<p>The scope of the project was too big. Time spent thinking about community aspects of the platform would have been better spent concentrating on how to improve the documentation process. This approach would have lead to a better prototype. Testing Community features with only three users in a single day was in my opinion insufficient.</p>
<p>After the project had come to an end, I realised how much more fun it had been than the one we did in the first semester. The sprint format proved to be a quick and effective tool for design exploration and validation.</p>
